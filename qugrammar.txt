;S is the main symbol--it ensures the subject number matches the verb and 
;gives the option to a simple equative sentence.
S->(SngNP SngPred | PlNP PlPred | DuNP DuPred | NP Pred) #.#
;the different types of subject (singular, plural, and dual) make sure that
;the proper type of adjective is used.
SngNP->[#DET#] {#ADJ#} #SN#
;A plural subject can also consist of two (or more) singular subjects
PlNP->[#DET#] {#PADJ#} #PN# | (SngNP | PlNP) #CONJ# SngNP
DuNP->[#DET#] {#DADJ#} #DN#
;NP is provided for sentences using the copula (that don't need number matching)
NP->SngNP | PlNP | DuNP
;SV stands for singular verb, PV=plural, and DV=dual
SngPred->#SV# [NP]
PlPred->#PV# [NP]
DuPred->#DV# [NP]
;Pred provides the generic fallback of trying the copula
Pred->#COPULA# (NP | Adjectival) | (NP | Adjectival) [#COPULA#]
;Adjectival provides a generic way to treat adjectives involved in a copula sentence.
Adjectival->#ADJ# | #DADJ# | #PADJ#
